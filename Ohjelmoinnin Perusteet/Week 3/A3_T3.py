# Create a program with a plain menu.

# Prompt username first
# Make program menu with following options:
# Print welcome message
# Welcome {Name}!
# Exit
# Exiting...
# Prompt user to choose option “Your choice:”
# Perform actions based on the user input
# Creating menus like this is a really handy way to make tiny text-based programs and there will be more exercises like this in the future.

# The expectation at this point is that the user is able to choose option by inserting corresponding number. No error handling is required, it will be introduced later.

# Other possible output variats:
